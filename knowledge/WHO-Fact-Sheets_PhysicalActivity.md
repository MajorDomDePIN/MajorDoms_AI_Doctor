# WHO fact sheets - Physical activity

​        26 June 2024                    

## Key facts

- **Regular physical activity provides significant physical and mental health benefits.**
- **In adults, physical activity contributes to prevention and management of  noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and  diabetes and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, enhances brain  health, and can improve overall well-being.**
- **In  children and adolescents, physical activity promotes bone health,  encourages healthy growth and development of muscle, and improves motor  and cognitive development.**
- **31% of** **adults and 80% of adolescents do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity.**
- **The global target set to reduce levels of physical inactivity in adults and adolescents is a 10% relative reduction by 2025 and 15% by 2030, from  the 2010 baseline.**
- **The global estimate of the  cost of physical inactivity to public health care systems between 2020  and 2030 is about US$ 300 billion (approximately US$ 27 billion per  year) if levels of physical inactivity are not reduced.**

## Overview

WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal  muscles that requires energy expenditure. Physical activity refers to  all movement including during leisure time, for transport to get to and  from places, or as part of a person’s work or domestic activities. Both  moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health.  Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports,  active recreation and play, and can be done at any level of skill and  for enjoyment by everybody. 

Physical activity is beneficial to  health and well-being and conversely, physical inactivity increases risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and other poor health outcomes.  Together, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours are contributing  to the rise in NCDs and placing a burden on healthcare systems. 

Improving levels of physical activity will benefit health and well-being and  contribute to attainment of global NCD targets and a number of the  Sustainable Development Goals. However, this will require increased  commitments and investments by Member States; innovation and  contributions from non-state actors; cross sector coordination and  collaboration; and ongoing guidance and monitoring from WHO.

## Benefits of physical activity and risks of sedentary behaviour and inactivity

Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable  diseases mortality. People who are insufficiently active have a 20% to  30% increased risk of death compared to people who are sufficiently  active. Regular physical activity is associated with:

- **in children and adolescents**, improved physical fitness, cardiometabolic health, bone health, cognitive outcomes, mental health and reduced body fat;
- **in adults and older adults**, reduced risk of all-cause mortality, risk of cardiovascular disease mortality,  incident hypertension, incident site-specific cancers, incident type-2  diabetes, and falls and improved mental health, cognitive health, sleep  and measures of body fat; and
- **for pregnant and post-partum women**, decreased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational  diabetes, excessive gestational weight gain, delivery complications,  postpartum depression and newborn complications. Physical activity has  no adverse effects on birthweight or increased risk of stillbirth.

Sedentary behaviour is any period of low-energy expenditure while awake such as  sitting, reclining or lying. Lives are becoming increasingly sedentary  through the use of motorized transport and the increased use of screens  for work, education and recreation. Evidence shows higher amounts of  sedentary behaviour are associated with the following poor health  outcomes:

- **in children and adolescents,** increased adiposity, poorer cardiometabolic health, fitness, and behavioural  conduct/pro-social behaviour, and reduced sleep duration; and 
- **in adults,** increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and cancer mortality and  incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes.

## How much physical activity is recommended?

The WHO [Global guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015128) provide recommendations for children (age 5 and up), adolescents,  adults, older adults, pregnant and post-partum women, and people living  with chronic conditions and disabilities. The recommendations detail the amount of physical activity (frequency, intensity and duration)  required to offer significant health benefits and to reduce health  risks. The guidelines highlight that any amount of physical activity is  better than none; all physical activity counts; all age groups should  limit the amount of time being sedentary; and muscle strengthening  benefits everyone.

The [WHO Guidelines on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under 5 years of age](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550536) provide recommendations on the amount of time in a 24-hour day that  young children, under 5 years of age, should spend being physically  active or sleeping for their health and well-being, and the maximum  recommended time these children should spend on screen-based sedentary  activities or time restrained. 

An [infographic](https://www.who.int/multi-media/details/who-guidelines-on-physical-activity-and-sedentary-behaviour) summarizes the current WHO guidelines on physical activity and  sedentary behaviour for all age groups. WHO develops guidelines through  an arduous process of reviewing scientific evidence and expert  consultations. Preparations are already underway for the next  guidelines, anticipated for publication in 2030. 

## Levels of physical inactivity globally 

WHO regularly monitors trends in physical inactivity. A recent study *(1)* found that nearly one third (31%) of the world’s adult population, 1.8  billion adults, are physically inactive. That is, they do not meet the  global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity  physical activity per week. This is an increase of 5 percentage points  between 2010 and 2022. If this trend continues, the proportion of adults not meeting recommended levels of physical activity is projected to  rise to 35% by 2030.

Globally, there are notable age and gender differences in levels of physical inactivity. 

- Women are less active than men by an average of 5 percentage points. This has not changed since 2000.
- After 60 years of age physical inactivity levels increase in both men and women. 
- 81% of adolescents (aged 11–17 years) were physically inactive *(2)*.
- Adolescent girls were less active than adolescent boys, with 85% vs. 78%, not meeting WHO guidelines.

Many different factors can determine how active people are and the overall  levels of physical activity in different population groups. These  factors can be related to the individual or wider social, cultural,  environmental and economic determinants that influence access and  opportunities to be active in safe and enjoyable ways. 

## How Member States can increase levels of physical activity

The [WHO Global action plan on physical activity](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241514187) provides policy recommendations for countries and communities to  promote physical activity and ensure everyone has more opportunities to  be regularly active. Examples of these recommendations include policies  that ensure access to walking, cycling and non-motorized transport; that increase physical activity opportunities in schools, workplaces,  childcare centres and in healthcare service delivery; and that increase  accessibility and availability of community sports and public open  spaces. 

Implementing effective policies to increase levels of  physical activity requires a collective effort, coordinated across  multiple government departments at all levels, including health,  transport, education, employment, sport and recreation, and urban  planning. It also demands national and local engagement from  nongovernmental organizations, various sectors, stakeholders and  disciplines to support the implementation of policies and solutions that are appropriate to a country’s cultural and social environment.  Priority should be given to policy actions that address disparities in  levels of physical activity, promoting, enabling and encouraging  physical activity for all.

## WHO response

WHO supports countries and stakeholders to implement the recommended actions by:

1. developing global policy guidance and guidelines, underpinned by latest evidence and consensus; 
2. supporting countries to develop appropriate policies that promote physical activity and multisectoral collaborations;
3. conducting advocacy to raise awareness of the multiple benefits of increasing  physical activity and support the development of economic analysis of  the impact of increasing physical activity and return on investment of  different policy interventions;  
4. developing technical tools  and training packages to help countries build capacity in the  implementation of policy and programmes across key settings and  innovations using digital platforms including through WHO Academy  courses, multi-country workshops and other knowledge exchange  activities;
5. convening, coordinating, and collaborating to  strengthen partnerships across sectors and between policy makers,  practitioners and researcher communities; and
6. undertaking global monitoring and reporting of progress on implementation of the *Global action plan on physical activity,* global levels of physical inactivity and progress towards a 15% relative  reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity by 2030.

WHO supports countries and stakeholders to implement the recommended actions by  developing global policy guidance and guidelines, underpinned by latest  evidence and consensus, to help countries develop appropriate policies,  investment cases and financing mechanisms.
